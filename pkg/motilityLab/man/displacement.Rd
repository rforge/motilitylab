\title{Track Displacement}
\usage{
displacement(x, limits = c(1, nrow(x)))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the track whose displacement is to be computed.}

\item{limits}{Vector giving the first and last row of the track. Can be used to avoid
extracting subtracks, which is exploited e.g. by
\code{\link{aggregate.tracks}}.}
}
\value{
The track's displacement, a nonnegative number.
}
\description{
Computes the Euclidean distance between the track's start and end points.
