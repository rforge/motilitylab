\item{measure}{the measure that is to be computed.}

\item{min.length}{minimal number of points in a prefix the measure is to be
applied to. Default is \eqn{1}.}
}
\value{
A function that applies the measure to every prefix of length at
least \code{min.length} is returned. This

of a given minimal length.
