\title{Simulate Data from Structural Equation Model}
\usage{
simulateSEM(x, b.lower = -0.6, b.upper = 0.6, eps = 1, N = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input graph, which may contain directed and bidirected edges.}

\item{b.lower}{lower bound for path coefficients.}

\item{b.upper}{upper bound for path coefficients.}

\item{eps}{residual variance.}

\item{N}{number of samples to generate.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing \code{N} values for each variable in \code{x}.
}
\description{
Interprets the input graph as a structural equation model, generates random path
coefficients, and simulates data from the model. This is just a dumb frontend to
lavaan's \code{\link[lavaan]{simulateData}} function and probably not very useful
except for quick validation purposes (e.g. checking that an implied vanishing
tetrad truly vanishes in simulated data). For more elaborate simulation studies, please
use the lavaan package or similar facilities in other packages.
}
\details{
Data are generated in the following manner.
at random from the interval given by \code{b.lower} and \code{b.upper} (inclusive; set
both parameters to the same value for constant path coefficients). Each bidirected
arrow a <-> b is replaced by a substructure  a <- L -> b, where L is an exogenous latent
variable. Path coefficients on such substructures are set to \code{sqrt(x)}, where
\code{x} is again chosen at random from the given interval; if \code{x} is negative,
one path coefficient is set to \code{-sqrt(x)} and the other to \code{sqrt(x)}. All
residual variances are set to \code{eps}.

\examples{
## Simulate data with pre-defined path coefficients of -.6
if( require(lavaan) ){
  g <- dagitty('graph{z <-> x -> y}')
  x <- simulateSEM( g, -.6, -.6 )
  coef(sem(toString(g,"lavaan"),x,fixed.x=FALSE))
}
