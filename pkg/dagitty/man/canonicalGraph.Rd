\title{Canonicalize an Ancestral Graph}
\usage{
canonicalGraph(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the input graph.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
 \item{g}{The resulting graph.}
 \item{L}{Names of newly inserted latent variables.}
 \item{S}{Names of newly inserted selection variables.}
}
}
\description{
Takes an input ancestral graph (a graph with directed, bidirected and undirected
edges) and converts it to a DAG by replacing every bidirected edge x <-> y with a
substructure x <- L -> y, where L is a latent variable, and every undirected edge
x -- y with a substructure x -> S <- y, where S is a selection variable. This function
does not check whether the input is actually an ancestral graph.
